<br/>
<p>There are just two new files in the code: The TagInput.js inside src/Components, our functional component, and the App.js file in the root that has been modified.</p>

<p>C'monn, you know how to do this.</p>

<p>There's already implemented a way of detecting blank inputs and prevent them.</p>

<h2>This is not a lib, it's just a simple component that I worked out, feel free to look around and use somethings you like!</h2>
